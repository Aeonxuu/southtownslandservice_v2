# Add a Job / Project — Automation Reference

This document is the complete instructions for adding a new job or project to the Southtowns Land Service website. After following the **prep steps**, share this doc and say _"add the job"_ — Claude will execute every step with no further input needed.

---

## How the site stores jobs

- All job metadata lives in [`southtownslandservice/src/data/siteData.js`](southtownslandservice/src/data/siteData.js)
- Each job uses `buildJob(id, title, description, imageCount, extension, categories)`
- Images are served from `southtownslandservice/public/media/jobs/{id}/`
- The site currently has **49 jobs** (IDs 1–49). Each new job gets the next sequential ID.
- **Featured jobs** appear in the top "Featured jobs" grid on the Jobs page. Currently IDs 42–47 and 49.
- `categories` is an **array of strings** — a job can carry multiple tags and will show up under every matching filter option on the Jobs page. The first category in the array is the primary one shown on the job card thumbnail; the detail modal shows all of them. Use existing categories: `Excavation`, `Driveway`, `Drainage & Utilities`, `Grading & Leveling`, `Brush Hogging`, `Forestry Mulching`, `Stump Removal`, `Snow Management`.
- **Regular jobs** appear in the "Other Projects" grid below. Both sections sort newest-first (highest ID = top).

## Your prep checklist (do this before asking Claude)

### 1 — Drop images into the staging folder

**Folder:** `raw_data/project/`

| File name | Rule |
|-----------|------|
| `cover.jpg` **or** `cover.png` | Required. This is the card thumbnail shown in the grid. |
| `1.jpg`, `2.jpg`, … `N.jpg` **or** `1.png`, `2.png`, … `N.png` | Required. Numbered gallery images shown inside the detail modal. Start at 1, no gaps. |

> All images in one project must share the same extension (all `.jpg` **or** all `.png`). The cover and gallery images must use the same extension.

### 2 — Fill in `raw_data/project/info.txt`

Create (or overwrite) a plain text file named **`info.txt`** inside `raw_data/project/` with exactly this format:

```
title: Your Project Title Here
description: Full description of the job. One paragraph. No line breaks inside the description.
featured: yes
```

or for a regular (non-featured) job:

```
title: Your Project Title Here
description: Full description of the job. One paragraph. No line breaks inside the description.
featured: no
```

**Field rules:**
- `title` — Plain text, no quotes needed. Use `&` for ampersands (e.g., `Driveway, Drainage & Pavilion Site Prep`).
- `description` — Plain text, one line, no quotes. Write it as a complete sentence or two describing the work done.
- `featured` — Either `yes` or `no`. Use `yes` for large, multi-image showcase jobs. Use `no` for smaller service examples.

### 3 — Confirm the folder looks right

Before asking Claude to run the automation, the `raw_data/project/` folder should contain:

```
raw_data/project/
├── cover.jpg       ← (or cover.png)
├── 1.jpg           ← (or .png)
├── 2.jpg
├── ...
├── N.jpg           ← last numbered image
└── info.txt        ← title, description, featured
```

## What Claude will do (automation steps)

When you say _"add the job"_, Claude executes the following steps in order:

### Step 1 — Read `info.txt`
Parse `raw_data/project/info.txt` to extract:
- `title`
- `description`
- `featured` flag (`yes` / `no`)

### Step 2 — Detect image extension and count
- Check whether `cover.jpg` or `cover.png` exists to determine the extension.
- Count all sequentially numbered files (`1.ext`, `2.ext`, … `N.ext`) to get `imageCount`. Stop counting at the first gap.

### Step 3 — Determine the new job ID
- Read `southtownslandservice/src/data/siteData.js`
- Find the highest existing job ID
- New ID = highest ID + 1

### Step 4 — Copy images to the public media folder
Copy every file from `raw_data/project/` (except `info.txt`) into:
```
southtownslandservice/public/media/jobs/{newId}/
```
Create the folder if it doesn't exist. Files keep their exact names (`cover.jpg`, `1.jpg`, etc.).

### Step 5 — Add the job entry to `siteData.js`
Append a new `buildJob(...)` call as the **last item** in the `jobs` array, immediately before the closing `];`:

```js
buildJob(48, 'Your Title Here', 'Your description here.', 15, 'jpg')
```

The trailing comma on the previous last entry must be present; the new last entry has no trailing comma.

### Step 6 — Update `featuredJobs` (only if `featured: yes`)
If the job is featured, update the `featuredJobs` filter on the last line of `siteData.js` to include the new ID:

**Before:**
```js
export const featuredJobs = jobs.filter((job) => job.id === 42 || ... || job.id === 47);
```

**After (example for new ID 48):**
```js
export const featuredJobs = jobs.filter((job) => job.id === 42 || ... || job.id === 47 || job.id === 48);
```

### Step 7 — Clean up the staging folder
Delete every `.jpg` and `.png` file inside `raw_data/project/` (cover image + all numbered images). Also delete `info.txt`. The folder must be completely empty after this step — verify with a directory listing before reporting done.

### Step 8 — Verify
- Confirm `siteData.js` parses cleanly (check for missing commas, unclosed brackets)
- Confirm all image files exist at the new media path
- Report back: new job ID, title, imageCount, extension, featured status
